Water, when taken in sufficient quantities, also cushions joints and protects tissues and organs. </td>

Learning to breathe properly will cause you to take in extra oxygen. This will cause chemical reactions in your body. Increased breathing will cause you to increase your calorie burn and in turn will speed up your metabolism.  </td>

A good balance of quality carbohydrates, healthy fats, and lean proteins promotes physical strength, mental alertness and will ultimately impact weight loss when needed and help build muscle. An abundance of fiber coupled with a variety of green vegetables makes up a balanced diet. Some basic Nutrition tips - Avoid large portions, eating direct sugar and fats, processed foods, eating after 7pm and excessive snacking in between meals.  </td>

                                        benefits of Water, Oxygen, and nutrition.  Exercise increases and improves your health, vitality and mental well-being.  Cardiovascular exercise strengthens the heart, resulting in more blood and oxygen flow throughout the body.  Strength training increases muscle and bone density as well as stability.  The right balance of exercise increases your endurance, strength, and flexibility thereby improving your shape and helping you meet your health goals.</td>
